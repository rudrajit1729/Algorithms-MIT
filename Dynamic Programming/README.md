- Longest Common Subsequence:
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).

- Longest Increasing Subsequence:
The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

- Unique Coin Change Ways:
Given an amount and collection of coins find the total number of unique ways for change

- Maximum Subarray & Subsequence:
Given an array of numbers find the subarray and subsequence having the maximum sum.
